# Each folder is a independent demo/test

### test 1 :  
* threejs "getting started", create scene & camera
* basic game loop with requestAnimationFrame & time managment 
* basic vertex and fragment shader to interract with mesh position/color via the GPU
* send JS computed variables to shader for interractive shader
* basic CPU 3DObjects manipulation using Quaternion angles and Vectors

### test 2 :  
* WIP (basic gravity/physics engine) 

### Ideas for later (maybe one day...) :  
* interractive vertex shader, subdivide mesh and apply locale modifications around cursor
* stream webcam input in material texture
* apply GPU realtime filter on image (e.g: chromakey on webcam stream (improvement of the canvas playground project))
* complex user input handler (keys, mouse, touchScreen, controllers, sensors)
* GPU based basic particles system
* GPU based physx
* learn how light stuff works
* basic ray-tracing implementation
* procedural mesh generation (basic terrain shape)
* procedural animated (vertex)shader
